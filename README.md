# Glimpse

A simple Mac app that lets you take screenshots and analyze them using Google's Gemini. Just capture any part of your screen and get instant text extraction or analysis. I mostly use it to get text from an image quickly or for translation purposes.

```bash
npm install
```

2. Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

4. Build for distribution:

npm run dist
```
